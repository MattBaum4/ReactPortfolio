YOU GOT THIS!!!

* For the About page, I can use Cards and icons to show what I have experience in
    as well as leaflet for a map to show I can do that too

* Contact page with emailjs and create an input field to email me  

!LEAVING OFF ----

The ABout Me page has been started, and I need to work out some of the styling kinks with getting
my profile picture with a brief intro ABOVE the 4 badges, then style them to look nicer.

Then I can add a leaflet map above them so itll go like this

LAYOUT (shitty wireframe)

MY FACE
BRIEF INTRO
LEAFLET (im from here)
BADGES
TECHNOLOGIES I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH

and that should be it...
